题目链接：[Clone Graph](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/ ) 

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. 

**OJ's undirected graph serialization:**

Nodes are labeled uniquely. 

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node. 

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}. 

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #. 

1. First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2. 
2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2. 
3. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle. 

Visually, the graph looks like the following: 

           1 
          / \ 
         /   \ 
        0 --- 2 
             / \ 
             \_/ 

这道题的要求是克隆一个无向图。

一个小技巧就是用hash表将图中节点与克隆的对应节点关联起来。剩下的就可以用BFS或DFS进行遍历图，当遍历到某一节点时，如果hash表中没有与之对应的克隆的节点，就需要为该节点新建一节点。
